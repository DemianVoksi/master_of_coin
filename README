This is a short script for getting the current details for your cryptocurrencies of choice in the terminal.

You will need a Coinmarketcap API key to use this script. It is free to make,
but you will have a usage cap. Free tier monthly cap is 10 000 credits.
Since Coinmarketcap parses the data for the cryptocurrencies based on their ID number,
coins with a higher ID number (which goes into the thousands) use more calls to the API.
Therefore it is easier to meet the cap if you are checking those coins.
I implemented a payload limit chooser which means you can manually set the payload for the API call: that is useful if
you know that you will track coins with a lower ID number- no need for the program to parse through a bunch of unneeded ID's.
If you choose not to enter the payload limit, it is automatically set to 5000,
and the number of credits used per call per coin is 25. 
Keep an eye on your cap usage!

To use the script, go into the key.py file and enter your key there.
Enjoy!
