This is a short script for getting the current details for your cryptocurrency of choice in the terminal.

You will need a Coinmarketcap API key to use this script. It is free to make,
but you will have a usage cap. Since Coinmarketcap parses the data for the cryptocurrencies
based on their ID number, coins with a higher ID number (which goes into the thousands)
use more calls to the API. Therefore it is easier to meet the cap if you are checking those coins.
Keep an eye on your cap usage if you are tracking coins with higher ID numbers.

To use the script, go into the key.py file and enter your key there.

I plan on adding the option to track several coins at the same time, as well as pulling your key from a config file.

Enjoy!
