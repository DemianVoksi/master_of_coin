This is a short script for getting the current details for your cryptocurrency of choice in the terminal.

You will need a Coinmarketcap API key to use this script. It is free to make,
but you will have a usage cap. Free tier monthly cap is 10 000 credits.
Since Coinmarketcap parses the data for the cryptocurrencies based on their ID number,
coins with a higher ID number (which goes into the thousands) use more calls to the API.
Therefore it is easier to meet the cap if you are checking those coins.
Right now with the payload limit set to 5000, the number of credits used per call is 25. 
Therefore, keep an eye on your cap usage!

To use the script, go into the key.py file and enter your key there.
Enjoy!
